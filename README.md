# MujtabaZahidi Portfolio Website

## Description
This repository is used for my portfolio website. Here, I will showcase and have a demo of my current and past projects. This website will be consistantly updated so the design might be different from when you last saw it.

## Demo
The link to the website can be found here: [mujtabazahidi.com](https://mujtabazahidi.com)

## Technologies Used
The tech stack for this portfolio website is currently:
 - HTML5
 - CSS3
 - Bootstrap 5.1
 - JavaScript
 - React (Create-React-App)

Currently there are no backend services needed for this website and as such it is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
 
## Installation
To install this project just follow these steps:
 - git clone https://github.com/mushi333/portfolio
 - cd portfolio
 - npm start (to run development build) or,
 - npm run build (to build a production ready version)
 
## Project Specifications and Constraints
The current project issue is converting the bootstrap code into JSX and React components.

Special thanks for StackEdit, the README.md was made on this website.
